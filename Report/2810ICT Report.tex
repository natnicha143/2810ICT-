\section{Software Technologies Assignment 1}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
	\par Word ladder is a program to go from a start word to a goal word of the same length by changing only one
	letter at a time. Another program file was implemented to test the functionality of the word ladder. The challenge was that every intermediary word must be present in a provided dictionary I.e. lead -$>$ load -$>$ goad -$>$ gold in 3 steps. The test files used the python unittest module. The users had the option of supplying a list of banned words, and selecting the shortest path for each start to goal word. 
	
\subsection{User Requirements}
	\textbf{The following list itemizes the user requirements for the implementation of the Ladder-gram program}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The user should be able to interact with the program by specifying the dictionary file name $($without the .txt extension$)$.
		\item The user should be able to interact with the program by specifying the source and target word.
		\item The user should be able to supply a list of words that cannot be used in the path solution by specifying the file name and placing it in the same directory as the program file.
		\item The user will have the option of choosing to evaluate the shortest path from source word to target word as the solution.
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Software Requirements}
	\textbf{The following list itemizes the software requirements for the implementation of the Ladder-gram program}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The program will notify the user if the inputs are invalid and the program will exit.
		\item The program will notify the user if a solution was found.
		\item If a valid solution is found the program will print it to the console along with the length of the solution.
		\item If the user chooses to input a list of banned words, the program will remove those words from the working dictionary. 
		\item The program will evaluate the shortest solution if the user requests.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Configuration Management and Version Control}
		\par 
		The development of this program required the use of version control software to evenly distribute tasks, as well as monitor the changes through source history. GitHub was created as an online hosting solution for git repositories. GitHub was used throughout this project to aid in collaboration between group members. GitHub was useful as it allowed group members to track changes and resolve any merge conflicts in a meaningful and lossless manner. Version control was used to ensure each developer could work on tasks individually. git records a log of past commits pushed to the repository which allows for backtracking of file versions.
